# perl_scripts
This is a set of scripts that I first wrote in 2005, when my team at work was keen on using Perl to write some application management scripts.  These scripts were written with the intention of learning to use Perl with a database.  Since I didn't want to muck around with Oracle, and I hadn't had any exposure to either MySQL or PostGres, I opted for BerkeleyDB.  The fervor for Perl, both personal and team, faded, and I didn't do anything with these scripts for a long time.  I dusted them off in 2015 to make some minor updates, and, since I've been playing around with Git, I decided to start working on them again.
